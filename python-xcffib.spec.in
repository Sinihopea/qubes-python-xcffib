%description
xcffib is intended to be a (mostly) drop-in replacement for xpyb.  xpyb
has an inactive upstream, several memory leaks, is python2 only and doesn't
have pypy support. xcffib is a binding which uses cffi, which mitigates
some of the issues described above. xcffib also builds bindings for 27 of
the 29 (xprint and xkb are missing) X extensions in 1.10.
